BWSI Medlytics 2023 - Challenge Project for Week 2 (Signal Processing and Deep Learning)

## Challenge Project
* Contains the Week 2 Signal Processing Challenge. This challenge requires students to work with segments of signals from electroencephalography, electrooculography, electromyography, respiratory airflow, and electrocardiography. From these segments they must predict whether the patient was in an aroused (awake), in non-REM1, non-REM2, non-REM3, or REM state. Created by Brian Xia
